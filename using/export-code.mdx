## Overview

Creatr allows you to export your generated web application code in multiple ways, giving you flexibility in how you work with your projects. Whether you need to integrate with version control, share with your development team, or run the code locally, there's an export option that fits your workflow.

## Export Methods

### 1. GitHub Export

Export your code directly to a GitHub repository for professional version control and collaboration.

**Process:**
1. Click on the GitHub icon in the header
2. Link your GitHub account if you haven't already
3. Configure repository details
4. Create the repository with one click

Once created, your repository will contain all code files, properly structured and ready for further development.

## What's Included in Exports

Regardless of which export method you choose, your export will include:

- Complete source code for your web application
- All assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- Configuration files
- Package dependencies
- Documentation (where applicable)

## After Export

Once you've exported your code, you can:

- **Extend It:** Add custom functionality beyond what's available in Creatr
- **Run It Locally:** Test and develop in your preferred local environment
- **Deploy Elsewhere:** Use custom hosting or advanced deployment options
- **Integrate Services:** Connect additional third-party services or APIs

Exporting your code gives you complete ownership of your project's source files, allowing you to build upon the foundation that Creatr provides while adding your own custom development when needed.
