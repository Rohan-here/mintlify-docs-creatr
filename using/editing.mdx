## Overview

In Creatr, editing your web app is quick and intuitive. Whether you're refining individual elements or adding new components, our AI-powered workflow makes it easy to stay agile and bring your vision to life.

## Editing Methods

### 1. AI-Powered Edits

Begin by entering a prompt that describes the changes you'd like to make. Our AI will analyze your request and generate the modifications needed for your web app. You can also attach images or documents to provide extra context.

**Example Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Change the header background to a gradient from blue to green."
```

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/editing-ai.png"
  alt="AI-Powered Editing - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/editing-ai.png"
  alt="AI-Powered Editing - Dark Mode"
/>

### 2. Selecting Elements

Activate the **Select Element** tool to target specific parts of your web app. When you hover over elements, a border highlights them, allowing you to isolate and edit individual components with precision.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/select-element.png"
  alt="Select Element Tool - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/select-element.png"
  alt="Select Element Tool - Dark Mode"
/>

### 3. Adding Components

Browse the Component Library to find pre-built UI elements—such as forms, carousels, or buttons—that you can add to your project. Simply select a component and instruct the AI to integrate it into your layout.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/component-library.png"
  alt="Component Library - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/component-library.png"
  alt="Component Library - Dark Mode"
/>

### 4. Refining Through Editing

Once your initial layout is generated, use the Creatr workspace to make fine adjustments:
- **Layout and Style:** Tweak positioning, colors, and typography.
- **Integrate Assets:** Add or update images, icons, and other media.
- **Leverage the Knowledge Base:** Refer to your project guidelines for consistency.

## Advanced Editing Techniques

### Combining Multiple Methods

For comprehensive updates, you can combine these editing approaches:

1. Use AI-powered prompts for major structural changes
2. Fine-tune specific elements with the Select Element tool
3. Enhance with pre-built components from the library
4. Modify assets directly through the Assets tab

### Using Context in Your Prompts

Providing context in your prompts improves the accuracy of AI-powered edits:

```plaintext
"The heading currently says 'Welcome to our site' but our brand voice is friendly and casual. Change it to something more welcoming and add a brief subtitle."
```
