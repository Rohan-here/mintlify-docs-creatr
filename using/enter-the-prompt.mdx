## Crafting Your Prompt

Your journey with Creatr begins by clearly defining your vision. A well-written prompt not only communicates your idea but also guides our AI in generating a codebase that aligns with your goals. Follow these steps to create a strong, effective prompt.

### 1. Describe Your Vision in Detail

Start by writing a comprehensive description of your web application. Include details about:
- **Design:** Layout, color schemes, and overall aesthetics.
- **Functionality:** Core features, interactive elements, and user experience.
- **Purpose:** The problem your app solves or the unique experience it offers.

**Example Prompt:**

```plaintext
"Develop a modern landing page for a tech startup featuring interactive UI elements, dynamic animations, and a bold, vibrant color palette. The design should be clean and minimalist, emphasizing user engagement and seamless navigation."
```

### 2. Enhance Your Prompt

Once you've drafted your vision, use the **Enhance Prompt** feature by pressing the corresponding button in the Creatr interface. This tool will:
- Suggest improvements for clarity and detail.
- Adjust technical specifics to better align with a production-ready setup.

/>

### 3. Add Attachments and OpenAI Integration

To provide additional context:
- **Attachments:** Include images that showcase your design ideas and functionalities. These attachments help our AI better understand your desired style.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/attachment-example.png"
  alt="Example Attachment - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/attachment-example.png"
  alt="Example Attachment - Dark Mode"
/>

- **OpenAI Integration:** Activate OpenAI features to fine-tune technical details. This ensures that the generated code aligns even more precisely with your vision.

### 4. Utilize the Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge Base** is a powerful resource for setting project-level guidelines:
- **Project Guidelines:** Establish consistent design rules, component usage, and best practices.
- **Unified Vision:** Maintain consistency across your app by defining a clear set of standards.
- **Future Reference:** Although we'll cover the Knowledge Base in detail on a later page, it's essential to know that it offers a centralized way to manage and enforce quality across your project.

/>

### 5. Edit for Fine Details

After the initial generation, use the Creatr workspace to refine your project:
- **General Layout:** Start with the broad structure generated from your detailed prompt.
- **Finer Details:** Gradually incorporate more specific adjustments and polish each element.
- **Iterative Process:** Continuously edit and refine until every component perfectly reflects your vision.

By following these steps, you'll create a detailed prompt that lays a solid foundation for your web app. Begin with a comprehensive vision, let our AI enhance it, and then use editing to add the fine details. With powerful tools like attachments, OpenAI integration, and a robust Knowledge Base at your disposal, you're well on your way to creating an extraordinary web application with Creatr.
