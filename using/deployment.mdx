## Overview

Creatr makes deploying your web app incredibly simple and fast. With one-click deployment, you can instantly share your creation with the world and manage different versions as your project evolves.

## Deployment Process

### 1. One-Click Deployment

When you're satisfied with your edits, click the **Deploy** button in the top bar. In just 2â€“3 seconds, your web app goes live, and you receive a shareable URL.

### 2. Version Management

Work on new features or experiment with design changes using the Version History module. You can:
- **Switch Versions:** Preview and revert to earlier iterations.
- **Deploy Alternative Versions:** Test new ideas or roll out special releases without affecting your main project.

## Deployment Options

### Shared Creatr URLs

By default, your project deploys to a Creatr-hosted URL:
- Format: `https://yourprojectname.getcreatr.app`
- Instant availability with no additional configuration
- Automatic SSL encryption for secure browsing

### Custom Domains

For production applications, you can connect your own domain:
1. Navigate to the Settings menu after deployment
2. Select "Custom Domain"
3. Follow the prompts to configure your DNS settings
4. Enjoy seamless mapping of your domain to your Creatr app

## Managing Deployed Applications

### Analytics

Once deployed, you can access analytics for your web app directly from the Creatr dashboard:
- **Visitors:** Track user traffic and engagement
- **Interactions:** Monitor how users interact with your application
- **Performance:** Review loading times and other performance metrics

### Updates and Redeployment

Making changes to a live application is just as easy:
1. Edit your project as needed
2. Click Deploy again to push updates
3. Your changes go live immediately, with no downtime
