## 1. Register or Login to Supabase

Before starting the integration, you'll need a Supabase account:
- [Register for a new Supabase account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) if you don't have one
- [Login to your existing Supabase account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in) if you already have one

A Supabase account is required to create projects and access their powerful backend services.

## 2. Access the Supabase Integration

In your Creatr dashboard, navigate to the **Integrations** section and select **Supabase**. A simple click launches the integration process, putting powerful backend services at your fingertips.

## Supabase Features

Supabase integration in Creatr allows you to add powerful backend functionality to your application through simple prompts. Here's how to leverage these features:

### Adding User Authentication

With Creatr's AI-powered platform, adding authentication is as simple as writing a prompt. No manual coding required!

#### Email/Password Authentication

To add standard email/password authentication to your application, try these prompts:

```
"Add user authentication with email and password using Supabase"
```

```
"Create login and signup pages connected to Supabase"
```

```
"Add user authentication to my app with the following pages: login, signup, forgot password"
```

The AI will automatically:
- Set up the necessary Supabase authentication configuration
- Create the required UI components (login forms, signup forms)
- Implement all the authentication logic (user registration, login, session management)
- Handle error states and validation

#### OAuth Authentication

Supabase supports various OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, and more. To use OAuth:

1. First, enable your desired providers in the Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to your Supabase project → Authentication → Providers
   - Enable and configure each provider you want to use (you'll need to create OAuth applications in each provider's developer console)

2. Then, use prompts like these to add OAuth to your application:

```
"Add Google OAuth login to my app using Supabase"
```

```
"Create a login page with options for GitHub and Google authentication"
```

```
"Add social login with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to my existing authentication system"
```

The AI will handle the integration, including:
- Implementing the OAuth flow
- Creating UI components with the proper social login buttons
- Managing authentication state and user sessions
- Handling successful login and error cases

#### Customizing Authentication

You can specify additional details in your prompts:

```
"Add user authentication with both email/password and social login options for Google and GitHub"
```

```
"Create a login system with email verification and password reset functionality"
```

```
"Add user authentication with a custom user profile page that shows user details"
```

### Working with Authenticated Data

Once authentication is set up, you can prompt Creatr to create features that use authenticated contexts:

```
"Create a dashboard that shows user-specific data from Supabase"
```

```
"Add a profile settings page where users can update their information"
```

```
"Create a system where logged-in users can save their preferences to the database"
```

The AI will automatically handle the authentication state and secure database operations behind the scenes.

### Working with Supabase Storage

Supabase provides a powerful file storage system that allows your application to store and serve files like images, videos, documents, and more.

#### Adding File Storage Features

To add file storage capabilities to your application, use prompts like these:

```
"Add image upload functionality using Supabase Storage"
```

```
"Create a file management system for users to upload and download documents"
```

```
"Add a profile picture upload feature that stores images in Supabase"
```

The AI will implement:
- Secure file upload and download functionality
- Proper bucket configuration in Supabase
- User interface components for file selection and upload
- Progress indicators and error handling
- Secure access policies (public or private files)

#### Common Storage Use Cases

Here are some specific storage features you can request:

```
"Create a photo gallery where users can upload and organize images"
```

```
"Add a document library that allows users to upload PDFs and view them in the browser"
```

```
"Implement a user avatar system with image cropping and previews"
```

```
"Create a file sharing system where users can upload files and generate shareable links"
```

For all storage features, the AI will automatically set up the necessary Supabase Storage buckets, handle file upload/download logic, and create an intuitive user interface.

### Configuring Redirect URLs

When implementing Supabase authentication in your Creatr project, you'll need to handle redirect URLs properly. By default, Supabase redirects authenticated users to `localhost:3000`, which needs to be updated for your deployed application.

#### Setting Up Redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard

First, configure your Supabase project's redirect URLs:

1. Navigate to your Supabase dashboard

    <img
      className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-home.png"
      alt="Supabase Dashboard - Light Mode"
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-home.png"
      alt="Supabase Dashboard - Dark Mode"
    />

2. Open the sidebar and select "Authentication"

    <img
      className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-auth.png"
      alt="Supabase Authentication - Light Mode"
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-auth.png"
      alt="Supabase Authentication - Dark Mode"
    />

3. Click on "URL Configuration"

    <img
      className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-url.png"
      alt="URL Configuration - Light Mode"
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-url.png"
      alt="URL Configuration - Dark Mode"
    />

4. Add your deployment URLs (e.g., `https://your-project.getcreatr.dev`)

    <img
      className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-linked.png"
      alt="Updated Site URL - Light Mode"
    />
    <img
      className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
      src="/images/supabase-linked.png"
      alt="Updated Site URL - Dark Mode"
    />

#### Prompting Creatr to Handle Redirect URLs

After configuring Supabase, you can use these prompts to implement the correct redirect URL handling:

```
"Update the Supabase authentication to use the current domain as the redirect URL"
```

```
"Make the Supabase auth redirect URL dynamic based on the environment"
```

```
"Add environment-aware redirect URL handling for Supabase authentication using window.location.origin"
```

Creatr will automatically:
- Implement dynamic redirect URL handling
- Use `window.location.origin` to support all environments
- Handle the authentication flow correctly

#### Pro Tips for Prompting

1. **Multi-Environment Support**
```
"Set up Supabase auth with dynamic redirects that work across preview, production, and custom domains"
```

2. **Local Development**
```
"Add Supabase authentication that works in both development and production environments"
```

3. **Custom Domain Support**
```
"Update Supabase auth to handle redirects for my custom domain and Creatr domains"
```

#### Troubleshooting Through Prompts

If you encounter issues, try these prompts:

1. **Fix Redirect Issues**
```
"Debug the Supabase authentication redirect - users are not being redirected correctly after login"
```

2. **Environment-Specific Problems**
```
"Fix the Supabase auth redirect for the production environment at https://my-app.getcreatr.app"
```

3. **CORS Issues**
```
"Resolve CORS errors in Supabase authentication redirects"
```

Remember to add all your possible URLs in Supabase's URL Configuration:
- Preview URL: `https://your-project.getcreatr.dev`
- Production URL: `https://your-project.getcreatr.app`
- Custom domain (if applicable)

---

By using these prompts, Creatr will help you implement proper redirect URL handling in your Supabase authentication flow, ensuring it works correctly across all environments.

By following these steps, you can quickly integrate Supabase into your Creatr project and unlock advanced backend capabilities with ease. Enjoy building and deploying your enhanced web application!
