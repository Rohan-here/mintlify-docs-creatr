## 1. Register or Login to Supabase

Before starting the integration, you'll need a Supabase account:
- [Register for a new Supabase account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) if you don't have one
- [Login to your existing Supabase account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in) if you already have one

A Supabase account is required to create projects and access their powerful backend services.

## 2. Access the Supabase Integration

In your Creatr dashboard, navigate to the **Integrations** section and select **Supabase**. A simple click launches the integration process, putting powerful backend services at your fingertips.

## Supabase Features

Supabase integration in Creatr allows you to add powerful backend functionality to your application through simple prompts. Here's how to leverage these features:

### Adding User Authentication

With Creatr's AI-powered platform, adding authentication is as simple as writing a prompt. No manual coding required!

#### Email/Password Authentication

To add standard email/password authentication to your application, try these prompts:

```
"Add user authentication with email and password using Supabase"
```

```
"Create login and signup pages connected to Supabase"
```

```
"Add user authentication to my app with the following pages: login, signup, forgot password"
```

The AI will automatically:
- Set up the necessary Supabase authentication configuration
- Create the required UI components (login forms, signup forms)
- Implement all the authentication logic (user registration, login, session management)
- Handle error states and validation

#### OAuth Authentication

Supabase supports various OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, Facebook, and more. To use OAuth:

1. First, enable your desired providers in the Supabase dashboard:
   - Go to your Supabase project → Authentication → Providers
   - Enable and configure each provider you want to use (you'll need to create OAuth applications in each provider's developer console)

2. Then, use prompts like these to add OAuth to your application:

```
"Add Google OAuth login to my app using Supabase"
```

```
"Create a login page with options for GitHub and Google authentication"
```

```
"Add social login with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to my existing authentication system"
```

The AI will handle the integration, including:
- Implementing the OAuth flow
- Creating UI components with the proper social login buttons
- Managing authentication state and user sessions
- Handling successful login and error cases

#### Customizing Authentication

You can specify additional details in your prompts:

```
"Add user authentication with both email/password and social login options for Google and GitHub"
```

```
"Create a login system with email verification and password reset functionality"
```

```
"Add user authentication with a custom user profile page that shows user details"
```

### Working with Authenticated Data

Once authentication is set up, you can prompt Creatr to create features that use authenticated contexts:

```
"Create a dashboard that shows user-specific data from Supabase"
```

```
"Add a profile settings page where users can update their information"
```

```
"Create a system where logged-in users can save their preferences to the database"
```

The AI will automatically handle the authentication state and secure database operations behind the scenes.

### Working with Supabase Storage

Supabase provides a powerful file storage system that allows your application to store and serve files like images, videos, documents, and more.

#### Adding File Storage Features

To add file storage capabilities to your application, use prompts like these:

```
"Add image upload functionality using Supabase Storage"
```

```
"Create a file management system for users to upload and download documents"
```

```
"Add a profile picture upload feature that stores images in Supabase"
```

The AI will implement:
- Secure file upload and download functionality
- Proper bucket configuration in Supabase
- User interface components for file selection and upload
- Progress indicators and error handling
- Secure access policies (public or private files)

#### Common Storage Use Cases

Here are some specific storage features you can request:

```
"Create a photo gallery where users can upload and organize images"
```

```
"Add a document library that allows users to upload PDFs and view them in the browser"
```

```
"Implement a user avatar system with image cropping and previews"
```

```
"Create a file sharing system where users can upload files and generate shareable links"
```

For all storage features, the AI will automatically set up the necessary Supabase Storage buckets, handle file upload/download logic, and create an intuitive user interface.
