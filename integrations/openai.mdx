### 3. Apply and Describe Your Integration

Click **Apply** to confirm your model selection, then describe how you want to integrate the model through the chat interface. Be specific about the functionality you need, for example:

```plaintext
"Create a chatbot that can answer questions about my product and also analyze images uploaded by users"
```

Creatr will generate the necessary code and components based on your description, integrating the selected AI models into your application.

## Tips and Tricks

### Refine Your AI Integration

You can refine and adjust the AI integration directly through the chat interface:

- **Improve Responses:** Try "Make the chatbot responses more friendly and conversational"
- **Add Features:** Say "Add the ability for the chatbot to remember previous conversations"
- **Modify Behavior:** Request "Change the AI to provide shorter, more concise answers"

The AI will update your integration based on these refinements without requiring you to start over.

### Optimize Credit Usage

- Use more efficient models for simple tasks to conserve credits
- Implement caching for common AI responses
- Set appropriate context lengths and rate limits

## Example Projects

Here are some examples of what you can build using the OpenAI integration:

### Interactive Game Assistants
Create an AI chess opponent that can play at various difficulty levels and explain its moves.

### Smart Content Creation
Build a tool that generates marketing copy, blog posts, or product descriptions based on simple prompts.

### Visual Analysis Applications
Develop applications that can analyze and describe uploaded images or provide insights on visual content.

### Intelligent Customer Support
Create a support chatbot that can answer questions, troubleshoot problems, and escalate to human support when needed.

### Language Translation Tools
Build translation tools with natural language understanding that preserve context and tone.
