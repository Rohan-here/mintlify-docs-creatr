## Overview

GitHub integration allows you to export your Creatr-generated web applications directly to GitHub repositories. This enables you to leverage professional version control, collaborate with other developers, and integrate your projects into broader development workflowsâ€”all without manually exporting and uploading code.

## Key Benefits

- **Version Control:** Track changes and maintain a complete history of your project
- **Code Collaboration:** Share your codebase with team members or the open-source community
- **CI/CD Integration:** Connect your repository to continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- **Backup Security:** Keep an external copy of your project's source code
- **Development Extensibility:** Extend your Creatr-generated code with custom development

## Export Process

### 1. Access GitHub Integration

Click on the GitHub icon in the header of your Creatr project dashboard to begin the export process.

### 2. Link Your GitHub Account

If this is your first time using the GitHub integration, you'll need to authorize Creatr to access your GitHub account. A popup will appear guiding you through the connection process.

/>

  src="/images/github-modal-open.png"
  alt="GitHub Authorization Modal - Dark Mode"
/>

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

After linking your GitHub account, you'll see options to configure your new repository:

- **Repository Name:** By default, this matches your Creatr project name
- **Description:** Optional field to add context about your project
- **Visibility:** Set to private by default for your security

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/github-modal-login-ok.png"
  alt="GitHub Repository Configuration - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/github-modal-login-ok.png"
  alt="GitHub Repository Configuration - Dark Mode"
/>

### 4. Create Your Repository

Click **Create Repository** to initiate the export. Creatr will automatically:

1. Create a new repository in your GitHub account
2. Generate all necessary project files with proper structure
3. Push the complete codebase to the repository
4. Set up appropriate GitHub configurations

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/github-modal-created.png"
  alt="GitHub Repository Created - Light Mode"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block mt-4 w-full rounded-xl"
  src="/images/github-modal-created.png"
  alt="GitHub Repository Created - Dark Mode"
/>

### 5. Sync Future Updates

As you continue developing your project in Creatr, you can push the latest changes to your GitHub repository at any time:

1. Make changes and updates to your Creatr project
2. Click the **Sync Repository** button when you're ready to update GitHub
3. Creatr will commit and push all changes with appropriate commit messages

## Important Notes

### Privacy and Security

- **Private Repositories:** All GitHub repositories created through Creatr are set to private by default
- **Access Control:** Only you and users you explicitly add will have access to your repository
- **Authorization:** You can revoke Creatr's GitHub access at any time through your GitHub settings

### Current Limitations

- **One-Way Sync:** Currently, the integration only supports pushing changes from Creatr to GitHub
- **No Pull Capability:** Changes made directly in the GitHub repository will not be reflected in your Creatr project

> **Coming Soon:** Two-way synchronization between Creatr and GitHub is on our roadmap. You can upvote this feature at [GitHub Two-Way Sync](https://creatr.featurebase.app/p/github-two-way-sync).

## Use Cases

### Development Handoff
Export projects to GitHub for your development team to extend with custom code and functionality.

### Continuous Deployment
Connect your repository to services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages for automatic deployment.

### Code Backup
Maintain an external backup of your project source code for added security.

### Open Source Projects
Share your Creatr-generated applications with the open-source community.

By integrating Creatr with GitHub, you gain the best of both worlds: the rapid development capabilities of AI-powered app creation and the robust version control and collaboration features of professional development workflows.
